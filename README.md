Notes about my research (towards my Master's in EE), specifically about solving ill-posed inverse problems for near-field antenna measurements.

If you've stumbled across this in your own research and would like to cite any of it, please [contact me](mailto:dave.noel@gmail.com)--a lot of this is either derived from or (hopefully eventually) source for more reputable work, and I'll be happy to point you in that direction.
